## DEFAULT SETTINGS FOR transcode-plex.sh
# Install in one of the locations that transcode-plex.sh searches as "prefs",
#  or alternatively keep a copy called "transcode-plex.sh" in your current working folder to over-ride.
# The preferences file is normally called "prefs", and is searched for within these locations in order:
#   ${BASH_SOURCE%/*}/transcode-plex/prefs
#   ~/.transcode-plex/prefs
#   ${BASH_SOURCE%/*}/../lib/transcode-plex/prefs
#   ~/Library/Application Support/transcode-plex/prefs
#   /Library/Application Support/transcode-plex/prefs
#   /var/lib/transcode-plex/prefs
#   /usr/local/lib/transcode-plex/prefs
# All of the options set within the preferences file can be over-riden by adding them as command-line arguments:
#   e.g. transcode-plex.sh CHAPTERS=1 COMTRIM=0 DAYS=2

# Information specific to your local system
DEST_DIR="/mnt/network/Plex"                 # Desination for video recordings.  Should contain "TV Shows" and "Movies" subdirectories, or symlinks to them.
SOURCE_DIR=""                                # Channels DVR folder (see Channels web interface settings) if NFS/SMB/AFP mounted.  Leave blank if running locally.  
HOST=""                                      # Default="localhost:8089".  To run this remotely, add e.g. HOST="channels-dvr.local". If no port, 8089 assumed.
SOURCE_PREFS=""                              # If left blank, will scan a default list of locations; CANNOT BE SET AS COMMAND LINE OVER-RIDE!
BACKUP_DIR=""                                # Location to deposit files if server offline.  Leave empty if not needed.
WORKING_DIR=""                               # Default="/tmp".  Useful if local space is limited, as can require many GB.
TMP_PREFIX=""                                # Default="transcode".  Prefix of temporary working directories within WORKING_DIR.  Name must not contain spaces.

# Options to tailor how the software runs:
SOURCE_TYPE="ts|mkv|mpg"                     # File extensions recorded by Channels, could be "mpg" or "ts|mpg|mpeg".  Avoid "m4v" if delivering to same directory.
SOURCE_FILE=""                               # If filled, specifies a particular filename and only searches for that file.  Usually only a command line option.
CHAPTERS=1                                   # Set to 1 to mark commercials as chapters.  Doesn't work if COMTRIM enabled.
COMTRIM=0                                    # Set to 1 to trim commercials from output file.  Takes priority over comskip.  Use at own risk.
DELETE_ORIG=0                                # Set to 1 to delete original files and 0 to disable.  CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK.
TEMP_COPY=0                                  # Copies input file to the working directory first; useful when running over erratic networks.
LANG="en-US"                                 # Force MP4 file tracks to have a language; Necessary for AppleTV 4 to see chapters.			
NICE=10                                      # For intensive tasks, set a "niceness" between 0 and 19, so as not to lock up the machine.
VERBOSE=1                                    # 0 = quiet; 1 = normal; 2 = detailed.
BUSY_WAIT=1                                  # Waits up to 4 hours for Channels to stop recording or comskipping if set.
DEBUG=0                                      # For development.  More explicit output.  Doesn't remove TMPDIR at the end.

# NEW FEATURE: A database is now kept of all converted files
# This can be deleted by setting CLEAR_DB=1 from the command line, and specifying the number of DAYS for which you wish to re-initiate transcoding
# e.g. if CLEAR_DB=0 and DAYS=1, the database will be repopulated with all existing files >1 day old, and anything from today will be transcoded.
TRANSCODE_DB=""                              # If left blank, will search for file in same directory as SOURCE_PREFS
CLEAR_DB=0                                   # Normally 0.  Best set on command line.  If 1, database is cleared, potentially restarting all transcode jobs again
DAYS=""                                      # Limit transcoding to shows recorded in the last N days.  Useful if server has been down or establishing DB.
                                             # If no database exists, files older then DAYS will be listed as already done.  Default is 10000, or 0 if CLEAR_DB=1.

# VERY COOL FEATURE: Phone notifications
# If you want phone notifications with IFTTT, enter your own IFTTT_MAKER_KEY here, and be sure to have curl on your system
# Please do not use someone else's IFTTT_MAKER_KEY or it will spam them
# Also, set up an IFTTT MAKER Applet event called "TVEvent" with a "Value1." notification format.
IFTTT_MAKER_KEY=""                           # Set to "" if you do not want IFTTT Maker notifications.  A 22-digit code.

# Encoder presets.  The defaults should work well for most people.   Only edit if you know what you're doing. 
PRESET="AppleTV 3"                           # HandBrakeCLI preset determines output default quality/resolution, run HandBrakeCLI -z to show list

                                             # For old/slow clients use "AppleTV 2" or (newer version) "Apple 720p30 Surround".
SPEED="veryfast"                             # This trades transcoding speed for filesize. In my own tests, veryfast often produces smaller files than medium!
                                             # Faster settings give theoretically larger filesizes and shorter transcode times; They do not affect quality.
					     # The only recommended options are: slow, medium, fast, faster, fastest, veryfast.
MAXSIZE=1080                                 # EXPERIMENTAL: Sets resolution limit (based on height). Works only for 16:9 ratio, e.g. 1080, 720, 576, 540, 360
ALLOW_EAC3=0                                 # EXPERIMENTAL: Enables preservation of Dolby Digital Plus (where available) in a manner playable by AppleTV 4.
EXTRAS=(--optimize --subtitle 1)             # Extra options set here.  Read HandBrakeCLI documentation before editing!

# Locations of programs if not in your path.  If required, the software will look for it in your path if you're not explicit (e.g. ="").
# AP_CLI (for iTunes tagging) and CAFFEINATE_CLI (to prevent sleep) must have values specified if order for those features to work.  Just =1 will work if in PATH.
# Full pathname, e.g. "/opt/local/bin/HandBrakeCLI" is necessary if not in PATH.
HANDBRAKE_CLI=""                             # Location of HandBrakeCLI binary.  This software is required for the code to work.
CURL_CLI=""                                  # Location of curl binary.  This software is required for the code to work.
JQ_CLI=""                                    # Location of jq binary.  This software is required for the code to work.
MP4BOX_CLI=""                                # Location of MP4Box binary (part of gpac package).  Only required if CHAPTERS=1.
FFMPEG_CLI=""                                # Location of ffmpeg binary.  Only required if COMTRIM=1.
CAFFEINATE_CLI=""                            # Location of caffeinate binary.  Prevents sleep, typically only found on Mac. Can substitute with other command. 
AP_CLI=""                                    # Location of AtomicParsley binary.  Only required for iTunes file tagging.  Leave blank if not required.
                                             # >0.9.6 non-mainline AtomicParsley is required.  Recommend using fork: https://bitbucket.org/wez/atomicparsley/

# Experimental/optional (marginal) improvements to iTunes file tagging can be had by using the TVDB API for lookups (experimental).
TVDB_API=""                                  # Optional.  For assisting in file tagging (for adding TV network tag to iTunes).


# WARNING: Most people should leave PARALLEL_CLI blank
# GNU parallel allows you to control the number of parallel transcoding jobs or farm out to other machines (target directory should be the same)
# Anyone using this will should read  GNU parallel documentation sufficient to set up their remote servers. Multiple PARALLEL_OPTS arguments should be added:
#   The memfree option requires a recent version of parallel >=2015, and should be tailored based on experience
#   If set up correctly, you can add multiple servers, e.g. "-S $SERVER1 -S $SERVER2", here too.  Remember to set ssh keys for password-free login.
#   --memfree 700M (RAM needed) is appropriate for default settings.  Some other quantities below:
#      "Apple 1080p30 Surround", veryfast, 1080i input:  700M
#      "Apple 1080p30 Surround", veryfast, 720p input:  425M
#      "Apple 1080p30 Surround", veryfast, 1080i input, MAXSIZE=720:  550M
# T.B.D. etherwake to allow Wake-on-LAN functionality
# T.B.D. send files over GNU parallel (for erratic networks)
PARALLEL_CLI=""                              # Location of GNU parallel binary.  Note that with -j 1 this will run like a normal non-parallel task.  
PARALLEL_OPTS=(-j 1 --nice $NICE --memfree 700M --noswap)
